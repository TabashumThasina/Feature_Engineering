Tesla claims every new vehicle builds includes hardware necessary fully autonomous , company says future over-the-air software updates , cars eventually capable driving themselvesâfor price . But , Full Self-Driving Capability , includes features assist driver parking , changing lanes highway , even coming complete halt traffic lights stop signs , remains misnomer . And federal investigations crashes involving Tesla vehicles add , regulators increasingly scrutinizing Tesla â claims . Earlier week , California Department Motor Vehicles put Tesla â review â public statements may violate state regulations prohibit automakers advertising vehicles sale lease autonomous unless vehicle meets statutory regulatory definition autonomous vehicle company holds deployment permit , agency â press office confirmed CR . autopilot Fatal 'Driverless ' Tesla Crash Raises Questions About Company 's Autopilot System CR Engineers Show Tesla Will Drive With No One Driver 's Seat Cadillac 's Super Cruise Outperforms Other Driving Assistance Systems As May 2021 , National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) initiated 28 special crash investigations crashes involving Tesla vehicles advanced driver assistance systems , including Autopilot Full Self-Driving Capability . And safety experts worry automaker 's bold claims risk kind misuse widely seen social media , owners demonstrated unsafe behavior relying much car â autonomous abilities . â Despite name , Full Self-Driving Capability suite requires significant driver attention ensure developing-technology features â introduce new safety risks driver , vehicles road , â says Jake Fisher , senior director auto testing Consumer Reports . â Not , evaluations determined several features â provide much way real benefits customers , despite extremely high purchase price. â Even Tesla said adding Full Self-Driving Capability turn Tesla self-driving car . Records California Department Motor Vehicles ( DMV ) released legal advocacy group Plainsite reveal attorney automaker told DMV officials March 2021 , Tesla vehicles equipped Full Self-Driving Capability still require driver steer , brake , accelerate needed . That makes less â Full. â Tesla distinguished carmakers almost decade building sleek electric cars industry-leading driving ranges developing new technology aimed one day creating fully autonomous , self-driving car . Though made significant strides automated driving , owners rely Tesla â driver assistance features necessarily add safety make driving easier , based Consumer Reports â extensive testing experience . Tesla Road Tests Tesla Model 3 Tesla Model S Tesla Model X First Drive : Tesla Model Y Throughout fall 2020 , assessed Full Self-Driving Capability features Tesla vehicles previously purchased regular testing program . The features , designed work certain situations , private parking lot highway driving , turned driver . We put feature suite test , results , detailed , mixed , say least . We contacted Tesla series questions article , company respond repeated requests comment . Read details findings , check video . Highlights From Our Testing Most features within Tesla â Full Self-Driving Capability suite worked inconsistently , including Autopark self-parking system around several years . Sometimes would recognize parking space suitable , â park . But drove space later , parking spot â exist . It also often â park straight parking lines . Smart Summon , allows car drive remotely location within private parking lot , would sometimes drive wrong side parking lot driving lanes , â always stop stop signs lot . Navigate Autopilot , activated , allows Tesla traveling highway autonomously take on- off-ramps make lane changes long destination programmed navigation system . We found performance inconsistent , system sometimes ignoring exit ramps set route , driving carpool lane , staying passing lane long periods time . The feature also would completely disengage times apparent reason . Traffic Light Stop Sign Control designed come complete stop stoplights , even green , unless driver overrides system . We found several problems system , including basic idea goes normal driving practice car start slowing stop green light . At times , also drove stop signs , slammed brakes yield signs even merge clear , stopped every exit going around traffic circle . Tesla â active driving assistance systems split two parts : The first , Autopilotâwhich includes adaptive cruise control ( Tesla refers Traffic-Aware Cruise Control ) lane keeping assistance capabilities ( Autosteer Tesla terminology ) âis standard every new Tesla . For evaluation , focused optional Full Self-Driving Capability suite driving assistance systems : Autopark , Auto Lane Change , Summon , Smart Summon , Navigate Autopilot , Traffic Light Stop Sign Control . Below , explain feature suite , intended use , performed tests . How We Did Testing Consumer Reports Consumer Reports We ran tests Full Self-Driving Capability features various times day , variety weather conditions , many different locations . We also made sure up-to-date hardware software available , testing version 2020.24.6.4 running Hardware 3 . This important note , Tesla â over-the-air software updates alter way features perform . The first three features evaluated storyâAutopark , Auto Lane Change , Summonâhave around years , improved time . However , Tesla â recent featuresâSmart Summon , Navigate Autopilot , Traffic Light Stop Sign Controlâgave us significant concerns usefulness safety . Autopark Autopark â helps automatically parallel perpendicular park car , single touch , â according information Tesla â website . Here â system works : As cruise either regular parallel parking spot parking lot , â P â pop center display screen indicating system found appropriate spot . Tap â P â touch screen shift gear selector Reverse , system automatically handle everything involved parking car , including steering braking . We found often worked advertised , times difficulty engaging . In cases , â recognize spots seemed appropriate drove past . This problem â â force â system workâit recognize appropriate spot . There seemed consistent reason sometimes recognize parking spot drove notice exact spot another drive-by . Similar features around years cars automakers , suffer problems . â Autopark also often â park straight lines , point â embarrassed got car realized parked cockeyed fashion , â says Kelly Funkhouser , head connected automated vehicle testing CR . Auto Lane Change While unique Tesla vehicles , feature straightforward works advertised . It â assists moving adjacent lane highway Autosteer engaged , â according Tesla . If driver hits turn-signal stalk change lanes Autopilot activated , car perform lane-change maneuver without steering input needed driver . An animation appears screen shows car move , wait make lane change car lane want move . â Ultimately , though , safety lane change still driver â responsibility , â Fisher says .

Tesla claims every new vehicle builds includes hardware necessary fully autonomous , company says future over-the-air software updates , cars eventually capable driving themselvesâfor price . But , Full Self-Driving Capability , includes features assist driver parking , changing lanes highway , even coming complete halt traffic lights stop signs , remains misnomer . And federal investigations crashes involving Tesla vehicles add , regulators increasingly scrutinizing Tesla â claims . Earlier week , California Department Motor Vehicles put Tesla â review â public statements may violate state regulations prohibit automakers advertising vehicles sale lease autonomous unless vehicle meets statutory regulatory definition autonomous vehicle company holds deployment permit , agency â press office confirmed CR . autopilot Fatal 'Driverless ' Tesla Crash Raises Questions About Company 's Autopilot System CR Engineers Show Tesla Will Drive With No One Driver 's Seat Cadillac 's Super Cruise Outperforms Other Driving Assistance Systems As May 2021 , National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) initiated 28 special crash investigations crashes involving Tesla vehicles advanced driver assistance systems , including Autopilot Full Self-Driving Capability . And safety experts worry automaker 's bold claims risk kind misuse widely seen social media , owners demonstrated unsafe behavior relying much car â autonomous abilities . â Despite name , Full Self-Driving Capability suite requires significant driver attention ensure developing-technology features â introduce new safety risks driver , vehicles road , â says Jake Fisher , senior director auto testing Consumer Reports . â Not , evaluations determined several features â provide much way real benefits customers , despite extremely high purchase price. â Even Tesla said adding Full Self-Driving Capability turn Tesla self-driving car . Records California Department Motor Vehicles ( DMV ) released legal advocacy group Plainsite reveal attorney automaker told DMV officials March 2021 , Tesla vehicles equipped Full Self-Driving Capability still require driver steer , brake , accelerate needed . That makes less â Full. â Tesla distinguished carmakers almost decade building sleek electric cars industry-leading driving ranges developing new technology aimed one day creating fully autonomous , self-driving car . Though made significant strides automated driving , owners rely Tesla â driver assistance features necessarily add safety make driving easier , based Consumer Reports â extensive testing experience . Tesla Road Tests Tesla Model 3 Tesla Model S Tesla Model X First Drive : Tesla Model Y Throughout fall 2020 , assessed Full Self-Driving Capability features Tesla vehicles previously purchased regular testing program . The features , designed work certain situations , private parking lot highway driving , turned driver . We put feature suite test , results , detailed , mixed , say least . We contacted Tesla series questions article , company respond repeated requests comment . Read details findings , check video . Highlights From Our Testing Most features within Tesla â Full Self-Driving Capability suite worked inconsistently , including Autopark self-parking system around several years . Sometimes would recognize parking space suitable , â park . But drove space later , parking spot â exist . It also often â park straight parking lines . Smart Summon , allows car drive remotely location within private parking lot , would sometimes drive wrong side parking lot driving lanes , â always stop stop signs lot . Navigate Autopilot , activated , allows Tesla traveling highway autonomously take on- off-ramps make lane changes long destination programmed navigation system . We found performance inconsistent , system sometimes ignoring exit ramps set route , driving carpool lane , staying passing lane long periods time . The feature also would completely disengage times apparent reason . Traffic Light Stop Sign Control designed come complete stop stoplights , even green , unless driver overrides system . We found several problems system , including basic idea goes normal driving practice car start slowing stop green light . At times , also drove stop signs , slammed brakes yield signs even merge clear , stopped every exit going around traffic circle . Tesla â active driving assistance systems split two parts : The first , Autopilotâwhich includes adaptive cruise control ( Tesla refers Traffic-Aware Cruise Control ) lane keeping assistance capabilities ( Autosteer Tesla terminology ) âis standard every new Tesla . For evaluation , focused optional Full Self-Driving Capability suite driving assistance systems : Autopark , Auto Lane Change , Summon , Smart Summon , Navigate Autopilot , Traffic Light Stop Sign Control . Below , explain feature suite , intended use , performed tests . How We Did Testing Consumer Reports Consumer Reports We ran tests Full Self-Driving Capability features various times day , variety weather conditions , many different locations . We also made sure up-to-date hardware software available , testing version 2020.24.6.4 running Hardware 3 . This important note , Tesla â over-the-air software updates alter way features perform . The first three features evaluated storyâAutopark , Auto Lane Change , Summonâhave around years , improved time . However , Tesla â recent featuresâSmart Summon , Navigate Autopilot , Traffic Light Stop Sign Controlâgave us significant concerns usefulness safety . Autopark Autopark â helps automatically parallel perpendicular park car , single touch , â according information Tesla â website . Here â system works : As cruise either regular parallel parking spot parking lot , â P â pop center display screen indicating system found appropriate spot .

We found often worked advertised , times difficulty engaging . In cases , â recognize spots seemed appropriate drove past . This problem â â force â system workâit recognize appropriate spot . There seemed consistent reason sometimes recognize parking spot drove notice exact spot another drive-by . Similar features around years cars automakers , suffer problems . â Autopark also often â park straight lines , point â embarrassed got car realized parked cockeyed fashion , â says Kelly Funkhouser , head connected automated vehicle testing CR . Auto Lane Change While unique Tesla vehicles , feature straightforward works advertised . It â assists moving adjacent lane highway Autosteer engaged , â according Tesla . If driver hits turn-signal stalk change lanes Autopilot activated , car perform lane-change maneuver without steering input needed driver . An animation appears screen shows car move , wait make lane change car lane want move . â Ultimately , though , safety lane change still driver â responsibility , â Fisher says . Summon This feature designed allow car drive short distance forward backward without driver behind wheel . Summon â moves car tight space using mobile app key , â according Tesla â website .
